This repository showcases a selection of coding projects I worked on during my undergraduate and graduate studies. I hold a BS in Biophysics and an MS in Data Science. Most projects have been developed in Python, with some in R, and I will continue to update this repository with independent work.

During my graduate program, I took courses in data mining, statistics, [machine learning](https://mkopischkie.github.io/), big data architecture, deep learning, design & analysis of algorithms, neurosymbolic topics in AI, and applied deep learning. I graduated in December 2025 and have been working as a Data Scientist on the AI team at Xcel Energy since May 2025.
