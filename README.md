This repository showcases a selection of coding projects I've worked on during my undergraduate and graduate studies. I hold a BS in Biophysics and am currently pursuing an MS in Data Science. Most of my projects have been developed in Python, with some in R, and I will continue to update this repository with new work.

As part of my graduate program, I've taken courses in data mining, statistics, [machine learning](https://mkopischkie.github.io/), big data architecture, deep learning, design & analysis of algorithms, neurosymbolic topics in AI, and applied deep learning. I will graduate in December 2025 and am excited to continue growing my expertise while sharing my progress here.
