This repository showcases a selection of coding projects I've worked on during my undergraduate and graduate studies. I hold a BS in Biophysics and am currently pursuing an MS in Data Science. Most of my projects have been developed in Python, with some in R, which I started learning a few months ago. I plan to expand my skillset by learning C, C++, and C#, and will continue to update this repository with new work.

As part of my graduate program, I've taken courses in data mining and statistics, with upcoming classes in machine learning, big data architecture, deep learning, natural language processing, and more. I expect to graduate in December 2025 and am excited to continue growing my expertise while sharing my progress here.
